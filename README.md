## Task 1: To-Do List
### Introduction and Features
This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The application provides basic functionalities such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed or incomplete, deleting tasks, and exporting tasks to a .txt file.

- Add Task: Users can easily add tasks by entering a description in the provided entry field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- Delete Task: Tasks can be deleted individually by selecting them from the task list and clicking the "Delete Task" button.
- Toggle Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete by selecting them from the task list and clicking the "Toggle Completion" button.
- Export to .txt: The application allows users to export their tasks to a .txt file for easy sharing or backup.

## Task 2: Calculator
### Introduction and Features
This is a simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. The application provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and a large display area for input and results.

- User-Friendly Interface: The calculator provides a clean and intuitive interface for performing arithmetic calculations.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Error Handling: The application handles errors gracefully and displays "Error" in case of invalid inputs or operations.
- Clear Functionality: Users can easily clear the input field with the "C" button to start a new calculation.

## Task 3: Password Generator
### Introduction & Features
This is a simple Password Generator application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to generate secure random passwords of varying lengths. The application allows users to specify the length of the password and whether to include special characters.

- Random Password Generation: Generates random passwords using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and optionally, special characters.
- Customizable Length: Users can specify the desired length of the password, with a default length of 8 characters.
- Special Characters Inclusion: Users have the option to include or exclude special characters in the generated passwords.
- Copy to Clipboard: Once a password is generated, users can easily copy it to the clipboard for convenient use. (needs pyperclip library)
